# Note that LineElement and parameter structs have three things:
# 1) Fields: These are actual fields within a struct, e.g. pdict in LineElement
# 2) Properties: These are "fields" within a struct that aren't actual fields, but can 
#                be get/set using the dot syntax and/or getproperty/setproperty!. 
#                E.g., the default fallback for getproperty is getfield
# 3) Virtual properties: These are values that only exist for parameter structs within 
#                        a LineElement type, and can be calculated using different 
#                        parameter structs within the LineElement. E.g. the normalized 
#                        field strengths requires BMultipoleParams and BeamlineParams.

# Often, quantities can be get/set as properties, and NOT virtual properties.
# For example, the s position of an element can be PROPERTY of the BeamlineParams 
# struct as one can sum the lengths of each preceding element in the Beamline.
